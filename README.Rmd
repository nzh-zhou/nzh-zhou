# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Nathan Zhou**

Here are some embarrassing facts about me to impel me to edit this file asap once I become more familiar with GitHub:

- I still call my mother "mummy"
- My libido is crazy high
- I'm an otaku
  - My best girl is Mai-san
- I wear an apron while cooking
- I have two pet turtles
